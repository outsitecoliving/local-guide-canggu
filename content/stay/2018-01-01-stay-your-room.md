# Your Room
You room will be refreshed at least every three days. If you would like a more frequent cleanings then just let the staff no.

Cleaning your room will include new sheets and a bed made tighter than you'll ever manage. If you are lucky, the team will folder you towel into a fancy form. They may also top up your soap and arrange your items on the sink counter more nicely then you.

I think they have OCD, but it's okay by me.
