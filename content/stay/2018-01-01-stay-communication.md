Unless you are taking the route of roaming charges, you are going to want a SIM card.

Any of the the street vendors you see selling electronics up and down Batu Bolong will be able to hook you up with a 10 GB SIM for $100k (~$7 USD). Personally, I frequently the kind Women under the Samsung sign on the left side of Raya Canggu after you make a right off Batu Bolong.

If you would like a local number, be sure to rock up to the window with a form of identification and your phone unlocked.
