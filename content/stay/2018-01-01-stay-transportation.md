# Transportation
Haven't noticed how hectic is can be getting around Bali? It honestly is that bad. You just need to get a bike.

Ideally, we would have a bike ready for you before you arrive, but maybe you were on the fence about riding and it took a couple sunburns to convince to take the leap.

Either way, our front desk will gladly get you a pair of wheels so your adventures can begin.

If motorbiking isn't in your future, you will want to make a friend at Outsite who rides or get comfortable with [Go Jek](https://www.go-jek.com/), this Google backed company is the Uber of Indonesian.
