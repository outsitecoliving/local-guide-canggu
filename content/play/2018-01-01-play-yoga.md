# Yoga
The most well know studios in Canggu are [Samadi]()https://www.samadibali.com/) and [The Practice](https://www.thepracticebali.com/yoga/schedule/). I have only visited Samadi for their Sunday farmers market, so I can't speak for their classes, but their space looks amazing. I have friends who enjoy The Practice, but, again, I can speak directly for it.

Give them both a go and let me know what you think. That way we can share your experience with others looking to enjoy a deep breathe with a side of streches.
