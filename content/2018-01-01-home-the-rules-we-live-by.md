# Our rules

## House
1. You must not create noise that disturbs other guests; code-enforced quiet hours start at **10:00 PM**. 
2. Smoking is not allowed on the property. Walk outside the gate if you have to take a pull.
3. No extra guests allowed. People other than those in your confirmed party may not visit or stay overnight on the rental property without prior authorization.
4. You must not exceed the occupancy limit associated with your reservation or a fee will be assessed per extra guest per day/night.
5. Please keep the space nice and neat. It is shared.
6. Please turn off all lights and appliances and lock all doors and windows on your way out. 
7. Pets are not allowed inside the space without prior authorization
8. Bikes are to be parked in designated parking areas only. Applicable fines/towing fees or issues are the sole responsibility of the vehicle owner. 
9. Any garbage must be placed in the proper garbage or recycling receptacle.

## Pool

2. Always shower before entering the pool.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
