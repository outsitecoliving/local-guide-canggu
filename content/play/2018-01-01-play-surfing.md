# Surfing at Oldmans
Canggu is a great place to explore your inner surfer. Get to the beach early in the morning before the fun is high in the sky. Boards from the beach rentals will run you about 50k.

If you are taking your bike you will need to pay the parking lot attendant 2k for a ticket to let you park. Don't haggle. Just pay the 2k.

After a good session in the wave you can find a fresh coconut to sip on for around 20k.
