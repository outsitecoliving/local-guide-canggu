## Before You Land
Let us know what time you land in Denpasar so we can arrange a driver. Trust me, it's much easier to get to the villa when you have someone picking you that who makes the trip frequently.

Our diver should have a sign with you name and something resembling "OUTSITE". They don't always get the spelling right. Ha, might quality control issue we have to live with here.

The ride from Denpasar to Canggu with cost you about 300.000 IDR. You can collect this cash at the airport before exiting through the gift shop.

If you aren't able to get me those flight details prior to arrival you can call our front desk at **+62 821 474 53614** with any transportation related questions. They will be expecting you.

## What's Different About Life in Bali
I probably don't even notice most of the differences and I never will, but we have a identified a few important ones we ask you to work on adopting during your stay.

#### Mosquito Netting
All beds at Outsite are equipped with this life safing barrier between you and the Mozzies. Close the curtains before you pass out, okay? We don’t want you waking up bitten to death. Wake up with your flesh free of the itchy bites.

#### The “Bum Gun”
Not a joke. No, the Balinese have their hygiene in order. It's just different than the way you may be use to if you are coming from the western world.

When you lack good infrastructure like Bali does, flushing paper products down the drain can cause real problems.

Instead of giving you a step-by-step instructions on the process I'll share this [seriesr](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bum+gun) from Youtube.

#### Bali Belly
Your tummy may turn on the island. Don't worry, it's normal. You body just needs time to adjust to the local bacteria. Turmeric jamu will do wonders. Thankfully, Oma Jamu just across the road has great options for you to choose from when are feeling so hot.

If your stomach aches turn to fever you will want to get antibiotics from the clinic just up the road.

In an effort to reduce the risk of getting this all too common scenario **do not** drink from the tap and frequent the restaurants that cater to the western crowds over the local warungs.

#### Local transportation
Bali does transportation a little differently. This stems from the village nature of the island. You wouldn't notice this if you were just stopping through on holiday, but we do as residents here.

Our local village transportation is called Trinity Transport. They are looking out for us, so we need to do the same. Recently they have noticed a couple of us grabbing lifts with companies that aren't approved.

**So, how do you know what's okay?**
If you would like a ride with four wheels, you need to source that driver through our front desk. If you are cool on two, Go Jek will work just fine.

**What's the deal with four wheels?**
If a vehicle with four wheels is coming from outside Canggu to pick you up you are stealing potential income from the locals.

**Why is Go Jek okay?**
Go Jek doesn't compete with local taxis (moped != car) and they are an Indonesian brand. While they are backed by Google, but still Indonesian.

**What about Grab?**
Grab is Asian, but it is not the preferred rideshare in Indonesian. That's still Go Jek.

**What about Uber?**
Even Uber doesn't want to operate in Asia. They gave up China for a 20% stake to Didi back in 2016. Now they have given up the rest of Asia for a 27.5% stake in Grab.

#### Saftey
There have been some incidences of theft, violent assault (punching), and sexual assault (groping) in the immediate area - primarily targeted towards females walking or riding scooters solo.

This happens mostly at night, but guests should be vigilant at all times. Primarily the motive is theft (so don't put bags on display).

Keep money and valuable jewelry tucked out of sight. Stay with buddies / groups wherever possible - particularly after dark.

There are many long stretches of road with no sidewalk between Outsite and the beach. Always best to walk towards oncoming traffic so you can see what's up.

Under no circumstances should you buy drugs or do drugs while in Bali. Sentences are extremely harsh. **Indonesia has the death penalty**.

#### Moto life
The best way to see Bali is from the drivers seat of a moped or helicopter, but let's keep it grounded. Motorbikes in Bali are by far the fastest form of traffice.

If you are like me, then you have told yourself bikes are WAY too dangerous for anyone sensible to drive. It's true that bikes are not toys and should be driven with caution every time.

By driving slow and taking proper precautions you can great reduce the risks of popping around on these sweet rides.
