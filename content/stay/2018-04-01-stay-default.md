First off, the Outsite staff are all rockstarts. They carry out a number of tasks every day to ensure you are happy and that these grounds are well kept.

You room will be refreshed at least once a week. If you would like a more frequent cleaning, no problem. Hang the sign on your door and they'll clean it right away.

Living in Bali means we have mossies to deal with. Put it on your calendar the Fumigation goes down every Tuesday from 2pm to 3pm. Unless you want to hangout in a cloud of cemicals you'll want to make plans to be else where during this time.

Life in Bali has a sort of rythme you won't find in many other places around the planet. Sun rises and sets nearly the same time everyday of the year. Expect to see to sun rise into the sky around 6:30 am and set over the horizon around 6:30pm. This rythme can make for a productive way of being.

Our lives here are Outsite have a regular cadance as well.
