#### Before You Land
Let us know what time you land in Denpasar so we can arrange a driver. Trust me, it's much easier to get to the villa when you have someone picking you up who frequently makes the trip.

Our diver will have a sign with your name and something resembling the word "OUTSITE".

The ride from Denpasar to Canggu will cost you about 300.000 IDR. Be sure you collect this cash at the airport before exiting through the gift shop.

If you aren't able to send along that information prior to arrival you can call our front desk at **+62 821 474 53614** with any transportation related questions. We will be expecting you.

## What's Different About Life in Bali
I'll be honest, I probably don't even notice most of the differences and I probably never will. It is impossible to catch all the nuances of this ancient culture. Thankfully, we work with many local actively educating us how to we start to see the world through their perspective.

#### Mosquito Netting
All beds at Outsite are equipped with this life safing barrier between you and the Mozzies. Close the curtains before you pass out and sleep pest free. No one needs to wake up bitten to death. Wake up with your flesh free of the itchy bites.

#### The “Bum Gun”
Not a joke. I said BUM gun. The Balinese have their hygiene in order. It's just different than what you might be use to if you are coming from the western world.

When you lack good infrastructure like Bali does, flushing paper products down the drain can cause real problems.

Instead of giving you a step-by-step instructions on the process I recommend spend time exploring this entertaining corner of [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bum+gun) from Youtube.

#### Bali Belly
Your tummy may turn on the island. Don't worry, it's normal. You body just needs time to adjust to the locals. And, by locals, I mean local bateria.

While you are out and about be sure to pick up Turmeric jamu. It does wonders for the tummy. Better yet, is that Oma Jamu has refigerators full of the tonic just across the street from Outsite.

Now if your stomach aches turn to fever let us know so we can put you in touch with the clinic just up the road.

In an effort to reduce the risk of getting this all too common scenario **do not** drink from the tap and hedge the risk by visiting the restaurants catering to the western crowds.

#### Local transportation
There is still very much a villiage style government at the local level. You wouldn't notice this if you were just stopping through on holiday, but we do as residents here.

Our local village transportation is called Trinade Transport. Trinade is lookinng out for us, so we need to do the same.

When you go to grad a ride **only** use a car or van sourced through the house manager or front desk and **do not** hail a ride through Grab or Uber under any circumstances.

**How do you know what rides are okay?**
If you would like a ride with four wheels, you need to source your driver through our front desk or the house manager. They'll make sure you are keeping the locals happy. If you are cool on two wheels, then Go Jek will work just fine.

**What's the deal with four wheels?**
Any vehicle with four wheels coming from outside Canggu to pick you up you is stealing income from the locals.

**Why is Go Jek okay?**
Go Jek bikes doesn't compete with local taxis, plus they are an Indonesian company.

**What about Grab?**
While Grab commands much of the Asian market, they stay of out of Indonesia. Indonesia is hyperlocal! Outsider have any extremely hard time winning market share here, so it's best to invest where the market is more accommodating.

**What about Uber?**
Even Uber doesn't want to operate in Asia. They gave up China for a 20% stake to Didi back in 2016. Now they have given up the rest of Asia for a 27.5% stake in Grab.

#### Saftey
There have been some incidences of theft, violent assault (punching), and sexual assault (groping) in the immediate area - primarily targeted towards females walking or riding scooters solo.

This happens mostly at night, but guests should be vigilant at all times. The primare motive is theft (so don't put bags on display). Keep money and valuable jewelry tucked out of sight. Stay with buddies / groups wherever possible - particularly after dark.

There are many long stretches of road with no sidewalk between Outsite and the beach. Always best to walk towards oncoming traffic so you can see what's up.

Under no circumstances should you buy drugs or do drugs while in Bali. Sentences are extremely harsh. **Indonesia has the death penalty**.

#### Moto life
The best way to see Bali is from the drivers seat of a moped (or helicopter). These are also the speediest form of transport around the island.

If you are like me, then you have told yourself bikes are WAY too dangerous for anyone sensible to drive. It's true that bikes are not toys and should be driven with caution. I hope you'll take every ride with this level of cuation.

By driving slow and taking proper precautions you can great reduce the risks of popping around on these sweet rides.
